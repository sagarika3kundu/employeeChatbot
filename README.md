# employeeChatbot

A Chatbot which can retrieve information from the internal documents of the Companies like Minutes of Meeting, Excel Sheets, Doc files, etc and 
answer the queries of the employees. This would save the time of the employees not requiring them to navigate/search for the path where the document is stored and the user 
would not have to search for the answers to their queries manually. The Chatbot is developed using RASA (open source framework) and Natural Language Processing for the modules.
